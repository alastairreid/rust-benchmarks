# `propverify`

This is a library/DSL for writing verification harnesses.

We see formal verification and testing as two parts of the same
activity and so this library is designed to be compatible
with the
[proptest](https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest)
fuzzing/property testing library
so that you can use the same harness with
either a formal verification tool or with a fuzzing tool.

## Acknowledgements

This crate is heavily based on the design and API of the wonderful
[proptest](https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest)
fuzz-testing library.
The implementation also borrows techniques, tricks and code
from the implementation - you can learn a lot about how to write
an embedded DSL from reading the proptest code.

In turn, proptest was influenced by
the [Rust port of QuickCheck](https://github.com/burntsushi/quickcheck)
and
the [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/) fuzzing/property testing library Python.
(proptest also acknowledges `regex_generate` â€“ but we have not yet implemented
regex strategies for this library.)
